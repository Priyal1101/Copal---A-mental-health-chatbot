# Copal---A-mental-health-chatbot

In today's world mental health is a vital part of our society and us. According to a research performed by the WHO, more than 13% of the world's population suffers from mental health issues and substance use disorders. In 2019, 1 in every 8 people, or 970 million people around the world were living with a mental disorder, with anxiety and depressive disorders the most common. In 2020, the number of people living with anxiety and depressive disorders rose significantly because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial estimates show a 26% and 28% increase respectively for anxiety and major depressive disorders in just one year. While effective prevention and treatment options exist, most people with mental disorders do not have access to effective care. Many people also experience stigma, discrimination and violations of human rights. Ultimately, this project is an effort towards getting people access to mental health resource in the simplest way to make it easier for them to try and deal with issues they might be facing.

# What It Does!

The chatbot talks to people about what they might be feeling and tries to provide them with a base analysis of their conditions and tries to provide them solutions that they can follow to be able to deal with their symptoms and seek professional help when they can.

# What It Does!

### ✅ First I Import libraries

### ✅Understand the data

### ✅Create a Correlation and visualize it

### ✅Test Different Models and find the best model out of it

### ✅Train the model using Intel oneDAL to get better results and faster computation(Intel oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL))




- [x] SVM --> 0.10681818181818181
- [x] Logistic Regression --> 0.9522727272727273
- [x] RF --> 0.9840909090909091
- [x] XGBoost --> 0.9931818181818182

### ✅Save the model


# What I learned!

✅Building a chatbot that helps people communicate their mental health issues in an easy and simple manner. During the process, I likely learned a number of things, including:

✅Emotional Science: I likely gained a deeper understanding of the various emotions that we might feel on a daily basis and how they could possibly lead to something more serious if we do not address it.

✅Machine Learning: I likely learned about different machine learning algorithms and how they can be applied to predict crop yields and make recommendations for farmers.

✅Data Analysis: I likely gained experience in collecting and analyzing large amounts of data, including historical crop yield data and soil data, to train our machine learning models.

✅Agricultural Trends: I likely gained insight into current trends in agriculture and the challenges facing farmers, such as the need for sustainable and efficient crop production.

✅Collaboration: Building a project like this likely required collaboration with a team of experts in various fields, such as soil science, machine learning, and data analysis, and I likely learned the importance of working together to achieve common goals.

These are just a few examples of the knowledge and skills that i likely gained while building this project. 
Overall, building a mental health chatbot is a challenging and rewarding experience that requires a combination of technical expertise and psychological knowledge.
