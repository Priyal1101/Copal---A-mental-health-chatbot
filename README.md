# Copal---A-mental-health-chatbot

In today's world mental health is a vital part of our society and us. According to a research performed by the WHO, more than 13% of the world's population suffers from mental health issues and substance use disorders. In 2019, 1 in every 8 people, or 970 million people around the world were living with a mental disorder, with anxiety and depressive disorders the most common. In 2020, the number of people living with anxiety and depressive disorders rose significantly because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial estimates show a 26% and 28% increase respectively for anxiety and major depressive disorders in just one year. While effective prevention and treatment options exist, most people with mental disorders do not have access to effective care. Many people also experience stigma, discrimination and violations of human rights. Ultimately, this project is an effort towards getting people access to mental health resource in the simplest way to make it easier for them to try and deal with issues they might be facing.

✅Building a chatbot that helps people communicate their mental health issues in an easy and simple manner. During the process, I likely learned a number of things, including:

✅Emotional Science: I likely gained a deeper understanding of the various emotions that we might feel on a daily basis and how they could possibly lead to something more serious if we do not address it.

✅Machine Learning: I likely learned about different machine learning algorithms and how they can be applied to predict user respinses and make recommendations for improvement
